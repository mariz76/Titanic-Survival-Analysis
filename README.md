# Titanic Survival Analysis

This project examines the Titanic dataset to explore patterns and factors affecting survival rates of passengers. Using Python, we load and analyze the data to uncover relationships between variables like passenger class, gender, and survival.

## Project Details
- Dataset: Titanic dataset (titanic.csv) containing passenger information such as age, class, gender, and survival status.
- Goal: To analyze survival trends and visualize how demographic factors influenced survival.
- Analysis:
    - Data loading and cleaning.
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
    - Visualizations of survival probabilities.
      
## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python: For data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: To manipulate and clean data.
- Seaborn & Matplotlib: To create insightful visualizations.

## How to Use
  1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Titanic-Survival-Analysis.git`
  2. Place the titanic.csv file in the same directory as the notebook.
  3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook file (Titanic Survival Analysis.ipynb) to follow the analysis and visualizations.
